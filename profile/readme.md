#Scientific Computing in Matlab

This organization contains documentation, code, and data for use in a course taught in the Behavioral and Neural Sciences Program (now Graduate Program in Neuroscience) 
at the [Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neurosience](https://cmbn.rutgers.edu), Rutgers University - Newark between 2011 and 2023. In 2025 we started using a different format, but some of the tutorial in this 
organization may still be useful to you. 

For each module, create your own repository based on the module repository template, and study the Matlab MLX files in the `/docs` folder.
Additional code for the assignments is in the `/code` folder.
